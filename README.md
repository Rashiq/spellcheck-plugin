# Spell Check Plugin


With this simple plugin you can easily toggle on and off the spell check setting in Sublime Text.  
This plugin can be useful for when you're writing commit messages or blog posts and want to quickly turn on the spell check, but don't want to have it enabled all the time.

#### Why not change the settings manually?

Because we are programmers. And we like spending too much time on automating the simplest tasks.
