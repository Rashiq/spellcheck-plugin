# Spell Check Plugin

With this simple plugin you can easily toggle on and off the spell check setting in Sublime Text.  

This plugin can be useful for when you're writing commit messages or blog posts and want to quickly turn on the spell check, but don't want to have it enabled all the time.

Just open up the command palette and type in the command `SpellCheck: Toggle On/Off`.

#### Why not change the settings manually?
